# Testing

The active profile decides which new tests are required. This file owns timing and quality.

## When

- For features, write profile-required tests after behavior and contracts stabilize. During construction, keep the static rail green instead of testing scaffolding repeatedly.
- For a bug fix, reproduce the failure before editing when practical. Keep the reproduction as regression protection when the active profile requires or permits it.
- Before a refactor, run the baseline and exercise the flow before and after. Add characterization coverage only when needed to prove preservation.
- Under prototype, do not add tests outside the exceptions defined by [the profile](../profiles/prototype.md). Under regulated, map required tests and inspections to the traceability record defined by [the profile](../profiles/regulated.md).

## What

- Test contracts and boundaries, not implementation details.
- One real end-to-end exercise of the changed flow outranks a pile of unit tests: it catches miswiring, invented APIs, and wrong-layer integration.
- Reserve unit tests for dense decisions: business rules, parsers, state machines, boundaries, and failure paths. Cover glue through the real-flow exercise.
- Boundary adapters are dense logic, not glue: test storage, serialization, and parsing failure paths (bad JSON, wrong shape, write failure), not just round-trips.
- Cover each material failure path through the strongest practical contract or real-flow exercise required by the profile.
- Prefer real objects. Heavy mocking signals poorly isolated side effects.

## Execution discipline

- Prefer targeted tests after stabilization; failures follow [verification](../workflow/verification.md).
- Run the full suite when the change is cross-cutting, the active profile requires it, or the repository defines it as a completion gate. Re-run a green test only when a later fix could affect it.
- Use quiet, failures-only output where the runner supports it.
- Match the repo's framework and neighboring test patterns. Keep tests deterministic and independent.
