# Standard Profile

Use this default for maintained software.

- Preserve public behavior and stored-data compatibility unless the task changes them.
- Keep changes localized but complete across affected callers, contracts, generated artifacts, and documentation.
- Exercise the real changed flow and relevant failure path. Add targeted tests after behavior stabilizes and run applicable repository gates.
- Run broad suites only for cross-cutting changes or repository-defined completion gates.

Report verified behavior, checks, compatibility decisions, and remaining risk. A failed, timed-out, skipped, empty, or unavailable relevant check is not a pass.
