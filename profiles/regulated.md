# Regulated Profile

Require traceable evidence for material decisions. This profile does not establish legal or regulatory compliance; use project-specific qualified interpretation.

- Record requirements, acceptance criteria, invariants, hazards or threats, failure behavior, and compatibility constraints before editing.
- Link material design choices to repository evidence and accountable requirements. Mark unresolved assumptions.
- Identify applicable authorization, lineage, retention, migration, rollback, audit, and recovery implications.
- Cover success, boundary, failure, recovery, authorization, and data-integrity paths. Verify migrations and mixed-version compatibility; document irreversible work and roll-forward recovery.
- Link each material requirement or hazard to a test, command, inspection, or approved manual check.
- Treat undocumented, flaky, timed-out, skipped, or unverified applicable checks as failures until explicitly dispositioned. Require an independent review pass for material risk without performative subagents.

Report traceability, deviations, approvals still needed, irreversible effects, and residual risk. Never invent a standard, approval, certification, or safety claim.
